    <p>This is a project I completed with Sophia Li as my partner. We were given a problem statement requesting us to create a data visualization in Python to address said problem statement. We created a series of line graphs addressing a possible correlation between unemployment and crime rates. Clicking the photo above will let you download a zip file containing our code, data, and Project Briefing, which consists of the original problem statement, design statement, and conclusion statement.</p>
