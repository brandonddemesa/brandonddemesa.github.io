	  <p>Hi, my name is Brandon! I am struggling to learn how to make a website right now, but let me tell you a little bit about myself. I am sixteen years old and a current junior at Ayala High School. I am in the Ayala BAC as a mallet player (a mallet instrument is on of those thing that is like a xylophone). I really love video games, cooking, and music. I am really loooking forward to this Computer Science class and this whole year!</p>
